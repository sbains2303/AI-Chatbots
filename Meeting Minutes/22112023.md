During this meeting, the team members showed the Client a version of the product for the first time. Albeit a very early stage implementation where the website didn't have much functionality. However, the Client seemed impressed with the database infrastructure and the vision that the team has for the project going forward. The Client asked many questions relating to the intended functionality of the website to which he receieved answers he seemed happy with. Finally, the Client and the team members agreed that the next step would be to get to a functioning website and then allocate the majority of the resources to developping the API.
