# Minutes 11/10/2023
Flurin and Marius (or the "Clients") began the meeting by introducing themselves. Following the Clients' introduction, the team members introduced themselves one by one, explaining what intrigued them about this particular project and stating any relevant experiences that each of them has had.   
After this first period of introduction, the Clients presented the project in more detail to the team. The Clients broke down the project into three parts:  
1. Research: the Clients and the team agreed to allocate the next two weeks to reasearch.
2. Creation of a webapp: the Clients stated that this step would consist of the creation of a webpage containing content of the team's choosing. The Clients don't want the team to allocate much time to the contents of the webapp and suggested using ChatGPT generated text.
3. Integration of a ChatGPT powered chatbot to the webapp: the final step consists of integrating an enhanced ChatGPT powered chatbot to the webapp. This chatbot should be trained on the contents of the webapp, the GPT LLM, files, and should be able to take files as input from the user in order to generate more relevant responses. The chatbot should also have a way to filter out questions which are not related to the webapp's contents.
   
In conclusion, the general tone of the meeting was very positive. The Clients seemed excited to see what the team would come up with, granting the team a lot of creative freedom especially when it comes to the development of the webapp.
